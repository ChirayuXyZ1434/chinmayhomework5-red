        <h1 id="anw">Answers for the above questions</h1>
        <h4 class="give">
            1.The names of all Valves are  Tricuspid Valve, Pulmonary Valve, Mitral Valve, and Aortic Valve
        </h4>
        <h4 class="give">
            2.Tricuspid: Located between the right atrium and the right ventricle, Pulmonary Valve: located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery,  mitral valve: located between the left atrium and the left ventricle, aortic valve: located between the left ventricle and the aorta.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="give">
            3.Two of the valves, the mitral and the tricuspid valves, move blood from the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) to the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles). The other two valves, the aortic and pulmonary valves, move blood to the lungs and the rest of the body through the ventricles.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="give">
            4.Heart valves are parts of your heart that act like doors. They open and close to let blood flow from one area of your heart to another. They help ensure that blood moves at the right time and in the correct direction. As the valves open and close, they create two sounds, which are your heartbeat.
